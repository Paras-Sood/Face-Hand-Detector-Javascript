# Face-Hand-Detector-Javascript
Made a basic Face and Hand detection app.js using handtrack.js

The app.js will play Stop it sound when it detects hand on the camera.

This was made to stop nail biters so as they get warned when they bring their hand near their face.(Will somewhat help in preventing their habit of biting nails)
